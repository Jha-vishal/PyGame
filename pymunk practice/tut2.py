#   pyglet is a cross-platform windowing and multimedia library for Python,
#    intended for developing games and other visually rich applications.
#   It supports windowing, user interface event handling, Joysticks, OpenGL graphics, loading images and videos,
#   and playing sounds and music. pyglet works on Windows, OS X and Linux.

# Spaces are the basic simulation unit in Pymunk. You add bodies, shapes and constraints to a space, and then update the space as a whole. They control how all the rigid bodies, shapes, and constraints interact together

    # A rigid body holds the physical properties of an object. (mass, position, rotation, velocity, etc.) It does not have a shape by itself. If youâ€™ve done physics with particles before, rigid bodies differ mostly in that they are able to rotate. Rigid bodies generally tend to have a 1:1 correlation to sprites in a game. You should structure your game so that you use the position and rotation of the rigid body for drawing your sprite.
body = pymunk.Body(1, 1666) # It require mass and moment of inertia

    # Add one or many shapes, bodies or joints to the space
